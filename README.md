1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces and dashes are fine. Folder naming convention should be similar to filenames. For paths, the folders, assets and files should be inside the root folder so they can be easily linked inside any .html files
    `index.html` 
2. Best practices for commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive of the changes made.
- Use the present tense and imperative mood (e.g. "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature").
- Reference any relevant issue or ticket numbers in the commit message.

6. Explain block Elements and also explain the list of block elements and why they are used from below:
- In HTML, block-level elements are those that create a block of content, typically starting on a new line and taking up the full width available. These elements are used to structure the content of a web page, and they can contain other elements as well as text. The following is a list of some common block-level elements and their purposes:

    1. html: This is the root element of an HTML document and contains all the other elements.
    2. head: This element contains information about the document, such as the title, metadata, and links to external resources.
    3. body: This element contains the main content of the page, such as text, images, and other elements.
    4. header: This element is typically used to define a header section of a page or article.
    5. nav: This element is used to define a set of navigation links that are typically used to navigate the website.
    6. main: This element is used to define the main content of the page, which should be unique to the page.
    7. section: This element is used to group related content together and often contains a heading.
    8. article: This element is used to define a standalone piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
    9. div: This element is used to group related content together and often has a specific purpose, such as styling or scripting.
    10. aside: This element is used to define content that is not directly related to the main content of the page, such as a sidebar.
    11. footer: This element is typically used to define a footer section of a page or article.
    12. span: This element is used to group inline content together, such as text or images.
    13. small: This element is used to define smaller text, typically for disclaimers or fine print.
- Block-level elements are used to structure the content of a web page, making it easier to read and understand. By using block-level elements appropriately, you can create a well-organized and visually appealing web page.
7. Explain why accessibility is important and also explain the accessibility properties like:
- Accessibility is important because it ensures that websites and web applications can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. Accessibility properties help make websites more accessible by providing additional information to assistive technology, such as screen readers. Some commonly used accessibility properties include:
- Landmark roles: Used to define regions of the page, such as the header, footer, and main content.
- Aria labels - Used to provide a descriptive label for an element that may not be clear from its content.
- Image alternative texts - Used to provide a description of an image for users who cannot see it.
8. What is CSS and how can we implement CSS to our html file (write a proper explanation with the code required to attach a CSS file inside html file)
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a styling language used for web pages. It allows you to apply styles like fonts, colors, and layouts to HTML documents. You can implement CSS in an HTML file by adding a style element in the head section of the HTML file or by linking an external CSS file to the HTML file using the link element.
- To link an external CSS file, add the following code in the head section of your HTML file
9. What is the difference between CSS property and value (write explanation and an example code)
- In CSS, a property is an attribute of an element that you want to change, while a value is the specific setting or option for that property. For example, the font-size property can have a value of 16px or 1.2em.
