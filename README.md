1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces and dashes are fine. Folder naming convention should be similar to filenames. For paths, the folders, assets and files should be inside the root folder so they can be easily linked inside any .html files
    `index.html` 
2. Best practices for commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive of the changes made.
- Use the present tense and imperative mood (e.g. "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature").
- Reference any relevant issue or ticket numbers in the commit message.
